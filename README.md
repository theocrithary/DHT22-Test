# DHT22-Test

Testing the temperature and humidity sensor.

The connection setup for the DHT22 is as follows...

* PIN 1 = 3.3V or 5V
* PIN 2 = Data and 3v3 via resistor - (D3 is data for this project, but can be changed)
* PIN 3 = Unused
* PIN 4 = Ground

I'm running a 10K resistor between pin 2 and a second 3.3V power source.
